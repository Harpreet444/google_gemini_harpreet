# Gemini Pro Vision - LLM and Image Analysis Application

This project is a Streamlit application that integrates Googleâ€™s Generative AI model (Gemini Pro Vision) for processing both text and image inputs. It demonstrates how to interact with the LLM (Large Language Model) using the `google-generativeai` library and load environment variables using Streamlit's `secrets` management.

## Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Ask questions in English and get responses from the Gemini Pro model.
- **Image Input**: Upload an image for analysis by the Gemini Pro Vision model.
- **Dual Processing**: The app supports processing either text, images, or both using the appropriate models.
- **Secure API Keys**: Environment variables are loaded securely via Streamlit's secrets feature.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. Streamlit
3. [Google Generative AI](https://developers.generativeai.google)
4. Python-Dotenv (for local environment variable loading)
5. PIL (Pillow for image processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-pro-vision-app.git
    cd gemini-pro-vision-app
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit google-generativeai pillow
    ```

3. Set up your environment:
    - Store your **Google Generative AI** API key in `secrets.toml` as follows:
      ```toml
      [secrets]
      GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"
      ```

## Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
